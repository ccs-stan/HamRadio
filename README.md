Amateur Radio Starter Info

As a new Amateur Technician, I have much to learn and remember from taking the test. This project was to help me with these challenges. 
This page is specific to my radio and my locale. Feel free to fork it and apply the information as it applies to you.
Attribution is not required, but would be appreciated.
